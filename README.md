XState is a state management and orchestration solution for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It has _zero_ dependencies, and is useful for frontend and backend application logic.

It uses event-driven programming, state machines, statecharts, and the actor model to handle complex logic in predictable, robust, and visual ways. XState provides a powerful and flexible way to manage application and workflow state by allowing developers to model logic as actors and state machines.
